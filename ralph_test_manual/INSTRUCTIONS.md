# Ralph System Instructions: Test_ralph_test_manual

## System Requirements
- Git
- jq (Command-line JSON processor)
- Python 3.8+ (for TUI/Orchestrator)
- Node.js (if using JS/TS projects)
- Selected CLI Tool installed (see below)

## Installation & Setup

### Manual / Template (Safe Mode)
1. Ensure you have a way to run the model from the terminal.
2. Edit `run_ralph.sh` to point to your specific executable.

Configure your specific CLI tool's API keys manually.

## Running Ralph

1. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_ralph.sh
   
   ```

2. Initialize Git (for atomic history):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Ralph Setup"
   ```

3. Start the Loop:
   ```bash
   ./run_ralph.sh
   ```

## Workflow Loop
1. Ralph reads `prd.json` to find the next incomplete task.
2. It reads `agents.md` for long-term context.
3. It generates a prompt and calls **claude-3-5-sonnet-latest**.
4. You verify the output. If valid, the task is marked done.
5. Repeat until all tasks are complete.
