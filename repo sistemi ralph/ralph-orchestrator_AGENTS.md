# AGENTS.md

> The orchestrator is a thin coordination layer, not a platform. Agents are smart; let them do the work.

## The Ralph Tenets

1. **Fresh Context Is Reliability** — Each iteration clears context. Re-read specs, plan, code every cycle. Optimize for the "smart zone" (40-60% of ~176K usable tokens).

2. **Backpressure Over Prescription** — Don't prescribe how; create gates that reject bad work. Tests, typechecks, builds, lints. For subjective criteria, use LLM-as-judge with binary pass/fail.

3. **The Plan Is Disposable** — Regeneration costs one planning loop. Cheap. Never fight to save a plan.

4. **Disk Is State, Git Is Memory** — `.agent/scratchpad.md` is the handoff mechanism. No sophisticated coordination needed.

5. **Steer With Signals, Not Scripts** — The codebase is the instruction manual. When Ralph fails a specific way, add a sign for next time. The prompts you start with won't be the prompts you end with.

6. **Let Ralph Ralph** — Sit *on* the loop, not *in* it. Tune like a guitar, don't conduct like an orchestra.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Building features into the orchestrator that agents can handle
- ❌ Complex retry logic (fresh context handles recovery)
- ❌ Detailed step-by-step instructions (use backpressure instead)
- ❌ Scoping work at task selection time (scope at plan creation instead)
- ❌ Assuming functionality is missing without code verification

## Specs

- Create specs in `specs/` — do NOT implement without an approved spec first
- Work step-by-step: spec → dogfood spec → implement → dogfood implementation → done
- The bar: A new team member should implement using only the spec and codebase

## Tasks

- Create code tasks in `tasks/` using `.code-task.md` extension
- Use `/code-task-generator` to create structured task files from descriptions
- Run tasks with `/code-assist tasks/<task-name>.code-task.md`
- Tasks are self-contained implementation units with acceptance criteria

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Git Hooks Setup

Run this once after cloning to install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
./scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

The pre-commit hook runs `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy` before each commit, catching CI failures early.

### Smoke Tests (Replay-Based)

Smoke tests use recorded JSONL fixtures instead of live API calls — fast, free, deterministic:

```bash
# Run all smoke tests (Claude + Kiro fixtures)
cargo test -p ralph-core smoke_runner

# Run Kiro-specific smoke tests
cargo test -p ralph-core kiro
```

**Fixtures location:** `crates/ralph-core/tests/fixtures/`
- `basic_session.jsonl` — Claude CLI session
- `kiro/` — Kiro CLI sessions (basic, tool use, autonomous mode)

**IMPORTANT**: You must smoke test after you make code changes.

### Recording New Fixtures

To create a new fixture from a live session:

```bash
# Record a session (outputs JSONL to session.jsonl)
cargo run --bin ralph -- run -c ralph.claude.yml --record-session session.jsonl -p "your prompt"

# Or capture raw CLI output
claude -p "your prompt" 2>&1 | tee output.txt
```

See `crates/ralph-core/tests/fixtures/kiro/README.md` for format details.

## TUI Validation

Use the `/tui-validate` skill to validate Terminal UI rendering. This applies **Tenet #2** (Backpressure Over Prescription) — using LLM-as-judge for subjective visual criteria instead of brittle string matching.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Validate header component from captured output
/tui-validate file:output.txt criteria:ralph-header

# Validate live TUI via tmux
/tui-validate tmux:ralph-session criteria:ralph-full save_screenshot:true

# Custom criteria validation
/tui-validate command:"cargo run --example tui_demo" criteria:"Shows bordered header with iteration count"
```

### Built-in Criteria

| Criteria | Validates |
|----------|-----------|
| `ralph-header` | `[iter N]`, elapsed time `MM:SS`, hat emoji+name, mode indicator |
| `ralph-footer` | Activity indicator (`◉`/`◯`/`■`), event topic, search display |
| `ralph-full` | Complete layout: header + content + footer + visual hierarchy |
| `tui-basic` | Generic: has content, no artifacts, proper dimensions |

### Live TUI Capture Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start TUI in tmux
tmux new-session -d -s ralph-test -x 100 -y 30
tmux send-keys -t ralph-test "cargo run --bin ralph -- run --tui -c ralph.yml -p 'your prompt'" Enter

# 2. Wait for TUI to render
sleep 3

# 3. Capture with freeze
tmux capture-pane -t ralph-test -p -e | freeze --language ansi -o tui-capture.svg

# 4. Validate
/tui-validate file:tui-capture.txt criteria:ralph-header
```

### Prerequisites

```bash
brew install charmbracelet/tap/freeze  # Screenshot tool
brew install tmux                       # For live TUI capture
```

### When to Use

- ✅ After modifying `ralph-tui` widgets
- ✅ Visual regression testing in CI
- ✅ Validating TUI state after specific interactions
- ✅ Creating documentation screenshots

See `.claude/skills/tui-validate/SKILL.md` for full documentation.

## PR Demos

Use the `/pr-demo` skill to create animated GIF demos for pull requests. This helps reviewers understand new features without reading code.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Script your demo (20-30 seconds, show ONE thing)
# 2. Record with asciinema
asciinema rec demo.cast --cols 100 --rows 24

# 3. Convert to GIF
agg demo.cast demo.gif

# 4. Embed in PR
# ![feature demo](./docs/demos/feature-demo.gif)
```

### Prerequisites

```bash
brew install asciinema
cargo install --git https://github.com/asciinema/agg
```

### When to Use

- ✅ Adding user-facing CLI features
- ✅ Demonstrating new commands like `ralph plan`, `ralph task`
- ✅ Showing workflow improvements

See `.claude/skills/pr-demo/SKILL.md` for full documentation.

## IMPORTANT

- Run `cargo test` before declaring any task done (includes replay smoke tests)
- Backwards compatibility doesn't matter — it adds clutter for no reason
- Prefer replay-based smoke tests over live API calls for CI
- Run python tests, using a .venv
